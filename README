Loads of spike code to think through what an implementation of a web-exposed definitive 
machine might look like. 

Basically, the server starts up a Java service and allows you to code via REST calls. 
The language is currently JavaScript and hooks into the Rhino framework. 

Major todos:
- Decide on design/package layouts - at the moment it's all just hacked together :)
- Add more mocks to provide better separation in the tests
- Once there's a clearer idea around the abstractions going to be used, need to code up 
some better JavaDocs
- Still need to think through the threading issues - and that means deciding whether we're
going to go EJB or stick with Spring... hmmm.

When all that's done, I'll add more documentation... for now it's possible to play using 
maven.
